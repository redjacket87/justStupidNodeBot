It's just simple node.js bot without any magic

At first clone project and make npm i, then configure your config.js file

module.exports = {
    token: 'your_token'
}

Check that you have installed mongodb on your server or just comment talking command runner in your index.js file.

Then just run your project make npm start.
If you run server on you local PC and have polling error just use VPN server for traffic.
Current version of bot running here @juststupidbot.
Enjoy!
