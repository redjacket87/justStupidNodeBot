It's just simple node.js bot without any magic

At first clone project and make npm i, then configure your config.js file

module.exports = {
    token: 'your_token'
}

Then just run your project make npm start.
If you run server on you local PC and have polling error just use VPN server for traffic.
Enjoy!
